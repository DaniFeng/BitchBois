A fun little visual applet I made in Processing (Java mode) that uses parametric curves and functions to animate bundles of lines.

Right Clicking - randomly generates a bundle of animated "pasta" in the location that you clicked it
Left Clicking - removes the most recent lines and curves object from the screen
Enter Button - makes the lines "spaz out" erratically. You can press enter again to revert back to the previous movement.
