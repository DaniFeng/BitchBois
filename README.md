A fun little visual applet I made in Processing (Java mode) that uses parametric curves and functions to animate bundles of lines.

Right Clicking - randomly generates a bundle of animated "pasta" in the location that you clicked it

Left Clicking - removes the most recent lines and curves object from the screen

Enter Button - makes the lines "spaz out" erratically. You can press enter again to revert back to the previous movement.

Also, I originally had exporting issues because I didn't put the specific font in my path folder. If you want to run this, make sure you have Java installed and that you have the font file too.
